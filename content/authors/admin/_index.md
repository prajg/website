I am a graduate student in the Department of Operations Research at University of Toronto supervised by Professor Chi-Guhn Lee. Currently, I am interested in developing framework to solve High Dimensional PDE using Reinforement Learning for potential applications in Pricing and Trading.

As an undergraduate student, I studied Actuarial Science and Statistics at University of Toronto. During undergrad, within academia, I was a research assistant at RiskLab, and a teaching assistant in the Deparment of Statistical Sciences as well as Rotman School of Management. Within Industry, I have worked at Milliman and Manulife.
