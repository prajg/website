I am currently a final year undergraduate student in Statistics, Mathematics and Actuarial Science at the University of Toronto. Within academia, I am a research assistant at RiskLab, and a teaching assistant in the Deparment of Statistical Sciences as well as Rotman School of Management.

Starting Fall 2020, I will be joining Dynamic Optimization & Operations Management Lab in the MIE department to work on Reinforcement Learning and Quantitative Finance. In the lab, I will be working under the supervision of Professor Chi Guhn Lee.

Recent coursework: Probabilistic Machine Learning, Stochastic Calculus for Asset Pricing, Statistical Methods for Machine Learning, Bayesian Statistics and Stochastic Processes
